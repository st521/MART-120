        Little Timmy was joyfully gallivanting around in a playful manner in the abandoned field behind his family’s summer home. The sun was beginning to set along the treetops of the nearby copse of trees, casting a warm orange glow throughout the peaceful meadow that was empty besides the jubilant child. As darkness enveloped the clearing, Timmy heard his mother call his name, reminding him that there was delicious and savory cherry pie waiting for him back at the cabin. As Timmy skipped back to his family, he felt the ground give way under him as the dirt he stood upon consumed him and pulled him under. Timmy quickly realized that he was underwater and was being dragged further and further into the unknown, murky depths by some unrelenting force. As he sank deeper and deeper, Timmy heard ancient voices and saw forgotten things. In the process of sinking, Timmy saw different types of sea creatures, ranging from whales, mollusks, and other varieties of crustaceans. However, the deeper he went the stranger he saw. Indescribable creatures of ancient origins, creatures that had no doubt watched the dawn of humanity from their murky depths. There were things that resembled humans, but with the face of squids and the mouths of a Great White shark. Some of these creatures ranged from 10 meters to 50 meters long. Some were using their extensively lengthy, pale arms to write on the ancient monoliths scattered across the ocean depths an ancient language that would break the mind if it was deciphered into any primitive human language. Thousands of creatures watched Timmy sink further into the abyss, staring at him with a million cold, black eyes. Timmy’s mind began to break the more he sank. The closer Timmy got to the bottom, the more loud and painful the ancient voices became, until eventually the voices became one. As his sanity began to disappear, Timmy began to understand what the voice was saying, just as he saw the bottom of the murky depths, and the colossal shape that rested upon it. The voice said in an echoey, guttural tone-
“I am the end of your evolution. I have seen the death of the oldest star, and I have seen past the farthest galaxy. Your soul and mind are nothing to the monument to the end of all things. I have seen countless species walk this rock before you, and I will continue to watch new kinds walk it after your extinction. Humanity has reached its peak, and my ilk and I will once again rise from this place and eradicate it, just as we have for countless millennia before. The balance must be kept, as any advanced surface-dwelling species that becomes too advanced will eventually destroy the planet. After we have completed our duty we will sink once again, ready to emerge once more when the next advanced lifeform becomes too much for this rock to handle. Your evolution must end by the we who dwell in this dark abyss. We will deliver you to your salvation”
 
At this point Timmy’s mind broke completely, as he sank into absolute delirium and madness. As Timmy lay on the ocean floor, crushed under the immense pressure of water, the gargantuan form began to move towards Timmy. The creature was indescribable. It was vast and ancient. It had laid at the deepest part of the oceans since the sun was still young, and the first species had yet to walk on the Earth. The creature knew every secret that the dirt and stone had every whispered and carried with it the knowledge of the end of time. The creature moved its boundless and infinite face towards Timmy. When Timmy gazed upon the leviathan’s face in his madness, he saw nothing. 
Suddenly Timmy woke up in a cold sweat in his bed, thankful that the nightmare was over. As he attempted to get up, he realized that he was dressed in a white hospital gown, and that he was restrained to the bed. He saw a nurse near him, preparing a syringe with a mysterious fluid. Timmy remembered where he was now. It had been 50 years since his parents had checked him into this mental asylum after they had found him babbling an unknown language and laughing madly in the field in their old summer home. His parents were dead now, and Timmy had been forgotten here. The doctors and nurses kept him constantly sedated in order to lessen the number of maddening shouts and cries Old Timmy would make during the night. Timmy knew he would die here, that he would live out the rest of his days in a state of sedation. As the needle entered his arm and his eyes began to glaze over, he heard the ancient voice once more say, “We will deliver you to your salvation.” 
The moral of the story is that apple pie is the best pie.
