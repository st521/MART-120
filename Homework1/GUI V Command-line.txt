The GUI and command-line interface are similar in the regards that both are used to navigate through and interact with a computer. The GUI uses the keyboard and mouse to interact with the machine using graphical representations of potential user actions. The GUI interface is much more common than the command-line due to its simplicity and easily understood visual components. The command-line is a built-in keyboard that requires commands to be used without the use of a mouse. The command-line method is much more complex; however, it does not use as much RAM and requires less CPU processing time.
